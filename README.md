# Birthday Fact Generator
A small one day project, which was created on and inspired by my birthday (March 14th).

User inputs their birthday in the format mm/dd and an API call is made to http://numbersapi.com which generate facts for: 
* The date - what happened in history.
* The number of the month - what's cool about this number.
* The number of the day - same as above.

# Get started

# This app was built using
* Express
* Handlebars
* (A little bit of BootStrap)
* Webpack
